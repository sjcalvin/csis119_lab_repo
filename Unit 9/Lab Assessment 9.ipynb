    "# Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You have just joined a team of disease researches that are performing disease population simulations. This research team has spent a long time trying to discover new types of cells that can combat the deadly E. coli bacterium. Since the E. coli bacterium is so deadly, the team must use simulations before they can play with the real thing. They have discovered a new type of cell called a Hunter Killer, which me be a very effective destroyer of E. coli cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team is now focused on determining the optimum number of Hunter Killer cells to use to combat a fixed number of E. coli cells in a confined space of a petri dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major class you need to get familiar with is the `Cell` class. This class is the bare-bones representation of a cell that will be used in the simulation. The focus of this project is to extend the cell base class into different classes and create objects (cells) from these various classes and use them in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major classes in this project: `PetriDish` and `Cell`.\n",
    "You are only required to extend the `Cell` class to create various types of bacteria/organisms in the petri dish. The `PetriDish` class will handle most of the simulation part of the project. You will, however, be required to complete sections in both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, each method (activity and task pair) needs to be executed in isolation. As an example, if you want to run `activity2_task1()`, do not run the other methods, such as (`activity1_task1()`) in the same execution of the script. The reason for this is to ensure the randomization is kept the same. Instead, comment out the methods not being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every task requires you to “begin simulation”. This is achieved by the function provided an instance of the `PetriDish` class. Unless explicitly stated, no arguments should be passed into this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Best Practices to Follow:\n",
    "* Write detailed comments and doc-string.\n",
    "* Organize and structure code for readability.\n",
    "* Write your own test cases to check correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setting up the Petri dish\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activity 1: \n",
    "Your first objective is to familiarize yourself with the `PetriDish` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating different petri dishes.\n",
    "The `PetriDish` class takes a single argument (size) when creating petri dish objects. Create a petri dish of size 5 for task 1 using the `activity1_task1()` stub, and execute the `begin_simulation()` method of the newly created `PetriDish` object. Don't forget to run the simulation to see the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Place cells into the petri dish.\n",
    " Take the time now to have a look at the `Cell` class. It's the basic structure of a cell, and has no distinguishing features other than the symbol c, which is used to distinguish this base class cell from other cells (which will come later). \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we can place this cell into the petri dish. \n",
    "In order to be able to complete this task you need to complete the `add_to_world` method in the `PetriDish` class. The class takes in a `cell` object as input and does three things. \n",
    "Firstly, it should be noted that the `PetriDish` class contains a dictionary called `self.world`, which is a mapping of a petri dish coordinate to a symbol of cell occupying that space. Use the x,y coordinate information in the cell to populate the petri dish map with the symbol of the cell. \n",
    "Secondly, the `PetriDish` also has a list of cells called `self.all_cells`, which it uses to keep track of all the alive cells. The new cell needs to be added to this list. \n",
    "Finally, as a preventative measure, the petri dish needs to keep track of all the free positions on the petri-dish. This is done via the `self.available_positions` list. This list contains a list of all the positions that are currently free. Obviously, when the petri-dish is created, this is completely full, with all the possible positions the petri-dish can take. As cells are added, the position the cell is in needs to be removed from the list. It also makes sense to check if the position is available before adding the cell to the petri-dish. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these things must be done in this method. Once all of these things are done create a petri-dish of size **30** and add **4** cells at positions **(0,0)**, **(5,5)**, **(10,10)**, and **(15,15)**, and begin the simulation. Use `activity1_task2()` stub to complete the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the simulation just print what the petri-dishes look like with the cells in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get familiar with the random generation of cells\n",
    "Similar to your previous tasks, create a new petri-dish of size 30.  Use `activity1_task3()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, using the `random.choice()` method (hint: and the available positions), create and add **10** cells to the petri-dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, begin the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extending base classes \n",
    "In particular, you will extend the Cell base class to create specialized variants of the Cell class. In this activity, all you will modify is the symbol for your class extensions, but in later activities, the distinguishing features of each cell type will become larger. This should be done by overriding the `_set_symbol_()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the `__init__` function for the extended class, use the `__init__`of the base class using the `super()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# `Generic` cell class\n",
    "In this task, you need to create a new class called the `Generic` cell class, which extends the `Cell` base class. The `Generic` cell class needs to have the symbol **o**. All other properties that are inherited from the `Cell` class are to remain the same for this activity.\n",
    "Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30** and, like before, create **10** instances of this `Generic` cell type with randomly allocated positions. Use `activity2_task1()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, begin the simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "# `Ecoli` cell class\n",
    "In this task, you need to create a new class called the `Ecoli` cell class, which extends the `Cell` base class. The `Ecoli` cell class needs to have the symbol **e**. All other properties that are inherited from the Cell class are to remain the same for this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30** and, like before, create **10** instances of this `Ecoli` cell type with randomly allocated positions. Use `activity2_task2()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, begin the simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# `Structure` cell class\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you need to create a new class called the `Structure` cell class, which extends the `Cell` base class. The `Structure` cell class needs to have the symbol **S**. All other properties that are inherited from the `Cell` class are to remain the same for this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30** and, similar to before, create **10** instances of this `Structure` cell type with randomly allocated positions. Use `activity2_task3()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, begin the simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "# `HunterKiller` cell class\n",
    "In this task you need to create a new class called the `HunterKiller` cell class which extends the `Cell` base class. The `HunterKiller` cell class needs to have the symbol **x**. All other properties that are inherited from the `Cell` class are to remain the same for this activity.\n",
    "Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30** and, similar to before, create **10** instances of this `HunterKiller` cell type with randomly allocated positions. Use `activity2_task4()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, begin the simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding the `Cells` to the `Petri-dish`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final task in this activity you do not need to create any more extended classes. However, you are required to create a `Petri-dish` of size **30**. Then add **10** instances each of `Cell`, `Generic`, `Ecoli`, `Structure`, and `HunterKiller` cells, at randomly allocated positions in the order. That is, create **10** randomly positioned `Cell` types first, then **10** randomly positioned `Generic` types, and so on. Use `activity2_task5()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, begin the simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create methods for handling static methods and static variables\n",
    "The scientists at the facility want to be able to extract statistics on the number of cells created. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you need to create methods for handling static methods and static variables. Essentially, these are variables and methods that apply to the class rather than the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Incrementing the cell counts\n",
    "Ensure that each newly instantiated cell of the extended `Cell` class increments the count of that class. For example, each time an `Ecoli` cell is created, the count needs to increment. This needs to be done for each class rather than just for `Cell`, (you cannot just inherit the number from the `Cell` class. This is because the scientists want to be able to know how many E. coli cells are created). \n",
    "Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly add **10** `Generic`, **20** `Ecoli`, and **30** `HunterKiller` cells to the petri-dish. The order of creation is not important. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you print the result, you should get `Cell` count of **60**, **10** `Generic`, **20** `Ecoli`, **0** `Structure`, **30** `HunterKiller`.\n",
    "Use `activity3_task1()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reset cell counts\n",
    "Firstly, create a static method in each class called `reset_count()`, which resets the count for that class to **0**. Then complete the implementation of the `reset_all_cell_counts()` function. This method resets all the counts for all the Cell classes (base and extended) to 0 using the static method you created just before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, confirm that the printed numbers after running `activity3_task2a()` (which runs the previous task twice) are twice those presented in `activity3_task1()`. This is because the counts are not reset.\n",
    "When you print the result, you should get `Cell count of **120**, **20** `Generic`, **40** `Ecoli`, **0** `Structure`, **60** `HunterKiller`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, confirm that running `activity4_task2b()` does not result in a doubling, and instead produces the same result as task1 twice. The difference here is that `reset_all_cell_counts()` is called in between and should reset all counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reduce count\n",
    "For each class that you have created, create a static method called `reduce_count()`. The purpose of this method is to reduce the count for that class by **1**.  Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30**. \n",
    "Randomly add **10** `Generic`, **20** `Ecoli`, and **30** `HunterKiller` cells to the petri-dish. The order of creation is not important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Call the `reduce_count()` method on the `Generic` class **5** times and the `Ecoli` class **5** times.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you print the result, you should get a `Cell` count of **50**, **5** `Generic`, **15** `Ecoli`, **0** `Structure`, **30** `HunterKiller`.\n",
    "Use `activity3_task3()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creaing lifespans\n",
    "In this task, for each class, create lifespans for each of the extended classes. This is to be done in a similar way to the implementation in the `Cell` base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen, the base `Cell` class has a lifespan of **100** iterations. Implement the following lifespans:\n",
    "* `Generic`: 100\n",
    "* `Ecoli`: 7\n",
    "* `Structure`: 10000\n",
    "* `HunterKiller`: 350\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is implemented, as usual create a petri-dish of size **30**, and randomly add **10** `Generic`, **20** `Ecoli`, and **30** `HunterKiller` cells to the petri-dish. This is to be done in the order listed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then use the simulate_n_steps method to step forward 1 step. This is done without providing any argument into the method. Then, for all the cells in the petri-dish, print the lifespan of the cell. Use `activity3_task4()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, all the cells just sit there and do not move. This is because every instance currently inherits the base class’ `intended_position()` method, which just returns the current x,y location of the cell. In order to make the simulation more interesting (and last more than two iterations), implement the following rules for the following cell types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Generic`: create a list of integers between **-2** and **2** (inclusive). The `intended_position()` method returns the current coordinates plus a random value applied to each coordinate. The random value is determined using the choice method on the list created previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Ecoli`: It does not move.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Structure`: It does not move.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `HunterKiller`: Similar to the `Generic` cell, but with the list of integers only containing the integers **-1**, **0**, and **1** (inclusive). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, create your final petri-dish of size **30** with **25** `Generic`, **75** `Ecoli`, **13** `Hunterkillers`, and **100** `Structure` cells in the order listed. Use `activity3_task5()` stub to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, begin the simulation, but this time pass in the argument `movement=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make it your own\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the petri-dish project to include a new type of object defined by the virus class. Make several types of virus, each with their own set of rules to compete with the bacterial cells in the original project. Some suggestions for effects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chess knight-like movement\n",
    "- Poisoning ability, which causes death on the target in 5 turns from being poisoned.\n",
    "- Vampirism (random chance any virus is spawned with vampirism (1%), and life of that particular virus particle is increased to 1,000 turns, and each neighboring cell has a 50% chance of being converted into a vampire).\n",
    "- Paired cells. Create a new type of bacterium that requires one Male and one Female cell type to be next to each other in order to reproduce.\n",
    "- Create a kill switch/key-press that instantly kills 50% of the living things in the petri-dish.\n",
    "- Modify the `HunterKiller` class such that each `HunterKiller` cell keeps track of its own kill count, and replicates when it has killed 100 `Ecoli` cells."
