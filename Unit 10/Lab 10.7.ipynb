    "You are an HR manager and you need to create a file containing wages for your employees calculated by their hours.\n",

    "# Steps for Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the `csv` imported module, write a script to read the contents of our `employees.csv` file that has the format shown in *Figure 8.5*:\n",
