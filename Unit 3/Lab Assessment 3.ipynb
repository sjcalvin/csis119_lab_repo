    "#### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked with building a URL file validator for a web crawler. A web crawler is an application that fetches a web page, extracts the URLs present in that page, and then recursively fetches new pages using the extracted URLs. The end goal of a web crawler is to collect text data, images, or other resources present in order to validate resource URLs or hyperlinks on a page. URL validators can be useful to validate if the extracted URL is a valid resource to fetch. In this scenario, you will build a URL validator that checks for supported protocols and file types.\n",

    "#### Introducing a split function:\n",
    "\n",
    "A split function is a string method. It is used to create a list of words that is separated by a particular delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A delimiter can be any character, comma, or space, or any word. For example, a student’s details (that is, name, age, and language) are given as a **“John,25,English”** string, and if you want to create a list. The string is delimited by “,”:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#example-1\n",
    "\tstudent_detail = “John,25,English”.split(“,”)\n",
    "\tprint(student_detail)\n",
    "\t[“John”, “25”, “English”]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#example-2\n",
    "\tstudent_detail = “John|25|English”.split(“|”)\n",
    "\tprint(student_detail)\n",
    "\t[“John”, “25”, “English”]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "A URL is in the form of `<Protocol>://<hostname>/<fileinfo>`. In order to be a valid URL, it must fulfill the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protocol**: This can be any value from given list, such as `http`, `https`, or `ftp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hostname**: Any string\n",
    "\n",
    "**File extension**: `fileinfo` can be any filename, but it must have an extension from given list (such as `.html`, `.csv`, `.docx`, `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s have a look at a few URL examples below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "`URL = <Protocol>://<hostname>/<fileinfo>`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices to Follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Writing detailed comments and docstrings\n",
    "2. Organizing and structuring code for readability\n",
    "3. `URL = <Protocol>://<hostname>/<fileinfo>`\n",

    "Note: Adding packages to your Python project\n",
    "Python has a wealth of built-in functionality; however, as with most languages, there comes a time to put more “tools in the toolbox”. This is done by importing packages into Python using the `import` keyword. However, what if your computer doesn’t have a particular package installed? The answer is `pip` which is Python’s utility for installing packages and is bundled with Python for versions 3.4 and later. There are a number of things that `pip` can do but the most common uses are installing a package, uninstalling a package, and listing the installed packages.\n",
