    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Abby has always dreamed of having her own ice cream shop. Now as a young entrepreneur she has decided to pursue her dream, but she needs some help in determining the financial viability of her plan. She has come up with a list of income and expense parameters and needs a simple program to input these parameters and calculate the monthly profit or loss as well as performing some variable cost what-if analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For expenses, she has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw ingredient cost per serving\n",
    "- Hourly labor rate\n",
    "- Real estate monthly rental\n",
    "- Utilities per month\n",
    "- Monthly advertising budget\n",
    "\n",
    "On the income side, she has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selling price per serving (assume only one size for simplicity)\n",
    "- Number of servings sold per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on some research, she has determined that a single employee can run the shop and she plans to have the shop open eight hours per day and six days per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices to Follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write detailed comments and doc-strings.\n",
    "2. Use logical variable names with a consistent convention.\n",
    "3. Organize and structure your code for readability.\n",
    "4. Use hand calculations to verify the formulas in your code. I.e. write your own test cases to check correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Completion:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create the text-based, menu interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the cels below to write a Python script with a menu driven, text-based user interface that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expenses:\n",
    "1. Cost per serving: 1.0\n",
    "2. Labor rate per hour: 7.5\n",
    "3. Shop rental per month: 800\n",
    "4. Utilities per month: 150\n",
    "5. Advertising budget per month: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "Income:\n",
    "6. Selling price (each): 4.0\n",
    "7. Servings sold per month: 500\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "Enter Selection (0 to Exit):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In which the current parameter value is displayed but the user can select and modify each one. For Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter Selection (0 to Exit): 1\n",
    "Enter cost per serving:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following as the default starting values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "serving_cost = 1.00\n",
    "labor_rate = 7.50\n",
    "shop_rental = 800\n",
    "utilities = 150\n",
    "advertising = 100\n",
    "servings_per_month = 1000\n",
    "selling_price = 4.00\n",

    "#### 2. Add Profit/Loss functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, your script should allow the user to input values for all the variables needed to calculate the profit (or loss) of Abby’s Ice Cream business. To add this functionality, start by adding the menu item\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. Profit/Loss Calculation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "under the **Analysis** section of the menu. If the user selects option **8**, the script should display something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter Selection (0 to Exit): 8\n",
    "The Ice Cream Shop will have a monthly profit/loss of 90.0 or 0.18 per serving.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform these calculations, you’ll have to think back to Algebra and calculate things like the total expenses and the total income on a monthly basis. Finally, in order to keep the values in monetary precision, you can use the `round()` function with a precision of **2**."
