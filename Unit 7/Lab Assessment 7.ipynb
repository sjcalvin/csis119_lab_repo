    "#### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You work in a government department in IT that deals with space exploration. You are asked to write a program in Python that simulates space exploration. The organization has asked you to create and populate a galaxy map and then analyze two exploration missions for their results. To summarize, the to-do list is as follows in this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create the galaxy map\n",
    "2.  Populate the galaxy map\n",
    "3.  Analyze two exploration missions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create the Galaxy Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploration can even commence, you need to create a map of the known galaxy. In order to do this, you are given the size of the galaxy to explore through the MAP_SIZE variable. For example, if the MAP_SIZE global variable is equal to 10, then this means that the galaxy to explore is a 10 x 10 grid. Since the MAP_SIZE = 100, this implies that the galaxy is a 100 x 100 grid for this challenge. Each square in this grid can be uniquely identified by a tuple, which is an (x,y) coordinate. As an example, a 3 x 3 grid will look like this:\n",

    "![grid-1.PNG](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/2dZlHBRiknfu03TLXbgk)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, since this is a 100 x 100 grid, the grid will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![grid-2.PNG](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/mJp1ZIFYS5e19UoztU7a)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices to Follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write detailed comments where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organize and structure code for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your own test cases in order to check for correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `generate_available_coordinates(map_size)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `generate_available_coordinates(map_size)` function in order to generate and return a list of all possible coordinates in the grid, remembering that each coordinate is a tuple of the form of (x,y). The function takes the size of the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `generate_empty_map(available_coordinates)` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to this function is a list of all the possible coordinates that you created from the previous task. This function needs to create a dictionary that maps a given coordinate with the symbol occupying that space. At the beginning, every coordinate should be initialized with a space (**‘ ‘**), with the exception of the (0,0) coordinate, which should be the initial position of the spacecraft (marked with an **‘S’**). The function should return the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 3 x 3 grid is initialized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![grid-3.PNG](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/pFXfpkqRQzq4nkzgSOKg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `get_unique_objects(galaxy_map)` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the function should be the galaxy map dictionary (that is, the grid). The grid starts off unpopulated. This function needs to return a frozen set of unique objects in the galaxy (that is, the symbols, including the spacecraft). So, as an example, the unique objects in the following grid are `{’S’, ’^’, ’*’}`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![grid-4.PNG](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/5U66y9riTcCuaZXaHMx8)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `display_galaxy(galaxy_map)` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The input for this function is the galaxy map dictionary. This function needs to return a string representation of the galaxy map according to the (x,y) coordinates in the dictionary. The best way to do this is to iterate over all of the coordinates and concatenate the string stored at the coordinate in the grid into a large string, and then return the string. For example, the output of the following galaxy would be **’S    ^ * ‘**. Take note that the spaces are also captured:\n",
    "\n",
    "![grid-5.PNG](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/t7d1F02TLCxZpTmV40Df)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of the galaxy exploration is to populate the galaxy map with information received from the space agency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The space agency has a station that sweeps outer space and detects nearby objects and their coordinates. The next group of tasks are focused on receiving information from the station and then populating the galaxy map accordingly. The `generate_object()` function provided for you receives information from the space agency in the form of *symbol*, *coordinate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `calculate_euclidean_distance()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to complete the `populate_galaxy_map()` function, you must first complete the `calculate_euclidean_distance()` function. \n",
    "This function takes a coordinate as an input and calculates the Euclidian distance from the starting position of the spacecraft, (0,0), to the input coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the function just returns 0, but this needs to be replaced with your own code for the distance calculation. Additionally, ensure that the return type is an integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the Euclidean distance is *distance(x,y) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the Euclidean distance between the following points is *sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(5) = 2.24*, which, when put through the int function in Python, gives *int(2.24) = 2*:\n",
    "\n",
    "![grid-6.PNG](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/sMjBNBHYRZaTbz79TTdc)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update the `populate_galaxy_map()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will be updating the `populate_galaxy_map()` function. The next task is to keep track of the data given to you by the `generate_object()` function, which will include information about the distance, the coordinates, and the symbol used to represent the object. The list should store the encountered objects as tuples in the form of (distance, coordinates, symbol).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the list returned by the `populate_galaxy_map()` function is sorted by distance in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step in completing the populate_galaxy_map() function is to continue to receive object information from the `generate_object()` function. Each object received needs to be added to the objects_encountered list, and the galaxy map needs to be updated accordingly. Keep doing this until you encounter a symbol of **‘G’** (which is the goal). At this point, break from the loop and return the sorted list of objects encountered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Complete the `calculate_path_to_goal()` function\n",
    "The final task is to complete the `calculate_path_to_goal()` function. The aim of this function is to list all the objects of interest and their coordinates that are closer to the spaceship than the goal. The objects of interest include fuel, which is marked with **‘F’**, and treasure, which is marked with **‘T’**. The input into this function is the list of objects encountered, which was determined in task 7. The output of the function is a list, which is sorted by the distance value in ascending order, of objects that are represented as tuples in the form of (distance, coordinates, symbol).\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze two exploration missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run_exploration()` function has been set up in such a way that two exploration missions are executed. Now we can focus on the similarities and differences between the missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `symbols_not_used_in_galaxy()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `get_unique_objects()` function to get the unique objects encountered for each of the missions. Complete the `symbols_not_used_in_galaxy()` function to find the symbols that were not used in the mission. The function takes the frozen set returned by the `get_unique_objects()` function completed in task 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `objects_encountered_in_galaxy1_not_galaxy2()` function\n",
    "Complete the `objects_encountered_in_galaxy1_not_galaxy2()` function. This function takes in as input the frozen sets of the unique symbols encountered in each galaxy, and outputs the symbols that were encountered in galaxy 1, but not in galaxy 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `objects_encountered_in_galaxy2_not_galaxy1()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `objects_encountered_in_galaxy2_not_galaxy1()` function. This function takes in as input the frozensets of the unique symbols encountered in each galaxy, and outputs the symbols that were encountered in galaxy 2, but not in galaxy 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `common_objects_encountered()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `common_objects_encountered()` function, which takes in as input the frozen sets of the unique symbols encountered in each galaxy, and outputs the symbols that are encountered in both galaxy 1 and galaxy 2 (that is, common to both galaxies).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete the `objects_encountered_in_both_galaxys()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `objects_encountered_in_both_galaxys()` function which, takes in as input the frozen sets of the unique symbols encountered in each galaxy, and outputs the symbols that are encountered in either galaxy 1 or galaxy 2 (that is, all the symbols encountered in either galaxy).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make it your own\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine whether there is enough fuel to reach the goal, assuming the spacecraft can initially cover a distance of 50 units, and every subsequent **‘F’** object encountered increases the amount of fuel by 15 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the simple distance-from-origin measure that we have implemented, implement a measure of the distance from each object to every other object. Then, implement greedy pathfinding to establish the best path to the goal and the total distance covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the preceding extension, implement the A\\* search, using the Manhattan distance as a heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manhattan distance is given by the following formula: _distance(x,y) = abs(x + y)_. One way to imagine this distance calculation is to imagine that only horizontal and vertical movements are allowed, and the cost/distance travelled with each movement is 1 unit. Therefore, to go to a position that is diagonally 1 square away, you would need to travel 1 unit horizontally and another vertically, making the Manhattan distance for those two points 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an extra challenge, iterate through the different randomized seeds until you find maps that have a valid solution, where the spacecraft has enough fuel to reach the goal."
