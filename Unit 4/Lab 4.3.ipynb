    "# Aim\n",
    "The aim of this activity is to create a password authentication feature using a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked to add a simple password authentication feature for a prototype that your team is setting up. One of your team members has advised the use of a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps for Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define **input(\"Enter your name: \")** as the name, **Pas$Word** as the password, and the Boolean variable first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initiate the `while` loop and for the password ask for the user's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Validate the password. If the password is correct, print \"**Welcome back, name**\". If the validation fails return an error and print the message \"**Incorrect password, try again...**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run your code in the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output should be as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Enter your name: Josh\n",
    "Enter your password: Pas$Word\n",
    "Welcome back, Josh\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your name: Josh\n",
    "Enter your password: none\n",
    "Incorrect password, try again...\n",
    "Enter your password:\n",
    "```"
