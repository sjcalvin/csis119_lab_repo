    "#### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the year 2017. You're working for an electronics company and have been tasked with modeling out the software for a cutting-edge tablet that will have a built-in face recognition front camera: a biometric tablet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class called `TabletCamera` and a class called `Facial_recognition` that will be the base classes of a derived class called `BioTablet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `TabletCamera` class that will be initialized with a `pixels` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a `Facial_recognition` class with a `scan_face` method that prints the message, **Scanning Face...**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a `BioTablet` class that inherits from both the `TabletCamera` and `Facial_recognition` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At the bottom of the script initialize an instance of the `BioTablet` class and pass it the value **\"12MP\"**. Then we call the `scan_face` method and also print out the `pixels` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script with _python3 main.py_ command and we should have an output that looks like _Snippet 7.91_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scanning Face...\n",
    "12MP\n",
    "```\n",
